### Objectives
- gain familiarity with GitHub
- create a GitHub Repository with a descriptive readme file

### Step 1 Create a GitHub Account

Remember you are developing a professional resource. It can be anonymous/psuedonym if you like, but keep it professional.

### Step 2 Look through the site, explore, and click buttons for 5-ish minutes

Curiosity is a great educator.

### Step 3 Create a Repository

A Repository (also called a **repo** in GitHub speak) is simply a file or directory where you store data and/or code.

To create a repository click on the `New Repository` button on your GitHub home page. 

Give your repo an appropriate name.
